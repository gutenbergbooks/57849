<br />San Jacinto Campaign</h2>
<h3 id="c2">FOREWORD</h3>
<p>San Jacinto, birthplace of Texas liberty!... San Jacinto,
one of the world&rsquo;s decisive battles!... San Jacinto, where,
with cries of &ldquo;Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!&rdquo;
Sam Houston and his ragged band of 910 pioneers routed Antonio
Lopez de Santa Anna, President and Dictator of Mexico and self-styled
&ldquo;Napoleon of the West,&rdquo; with his proud army, and
changed the map of North America!</p>
<p>Here is a story that has thrilled Texans for more than a century
... a story of desperate valor and high adventure; of grim
hardship, tragedy and romance ... the story of the epochal battle
that established the independent Lone Star Republic, on April
21, 1836, and indelibly inscribed the names of Texas patriots on
history&rsquo;s scroll of American immortals.</p>
<p>The actual battle of San Jacinto lasted less than twenty minutes,
but it was in the making for six years. It had its prelude
in the oppressive Mexican edict of April 6, 1830, prohibiting further
emigration of Anglo-Americans from the United States to
Texas; in the disturbance at Anahuac and in the battle of Velasco,
in 1832; in the imprisonment of Stephen F. Austin, the
&ldquo;Father of Texas,&rdquo; in Mexico in 1834.</p>
<p>Immediate preliminaries were the skirmish over a cannon at
Gonzales, the capture of Goliad, the &ldquo;Grass Fight,&rdquo; and the siege
and capture of San Antonio ... all in 1835. The Texas Declaration
of Independence at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 2,
1836, officially signalized the revolution.</p>
<h3 id="c3">RETREAT FROM GONZALES</h3>
<p>Four days after the Declaration of Independence, news came
to the convention on the Brazos of the desperate plight of Colonel
William Barret Travis, under siege at the Alamo in San Antonio.
Sam Houston, commander-in-chief of the Texas Army, left
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Washington post-haste for Gonzales, to take command of the
troops there and go to the aid of Travis. He arrived there on the
11th, and at about dark learned from two Mexicans who had just
arrived from San Antonio that the Alamo had fallen and its 183
brave defenders massacred. This was confirmed two days later by
Mrs. Almeron Dickinson who had been released by the Mexicans
after seeing her lieutenant husband killed in the old mission. She
was trudging toward Gonzales with her babe in her arms when
the Texas army scouts found her.</p>
<p>The reports of the Alamo slaughter terrified the people of
Gonzales. They were panic-stricken by the general belief that
Santa Anna next would sweep eastward with his well-trained
army, in a drive to wipe the rebellious Texans from the face of
the earth.</p>
<p>Then began the exodus of frantic colonists known to Texas
history as the &ldquo;Runaway Scrape.&rdquo; Men, women and children
packed what belongings they could take in wagons and carts,
on horseback, or on their own backs, and fled their homes in
terror across the rain soaked country ... all moving eastward
toward the Louisiana border to escape the wrath of the bloodthirsty
Santa Anna.</p>
<p>General Houston, realizing that his few hundred green troops
were no match for the well-drilled hordes from Mexico, evacuated
Gonzales and had the rear guard put the town to the torch.
The Texans crossed the Colorado River on the 17th at Jesse
Burnam&rsquo;s, and camped there for two days. Then the army resumed
its march down the east bank to Benjamin Beason&rsquo;s crossing,
some twenty miles below, near the present town of Columbus.
Camp was pitched at Beason&rsquo;s on the 20th.</p>
<p>Had the retreating column been fifty miles farther south,
the troops might have heard the distant rumble and crackle
of gunfire. On March 19, Colonel James Walker Fannin Jr.,
commanding about 450 volunteers withdrawing from Goliad
toward Victoria, was defeated in battle on Coleto Creek by
General Jose Urrea&rsquo;s forces of 1200 infantry and 700 cavalry.
Fannin surrendered. On Palm Sunday, March 27, he and 352
of his men were marched out on the roads near Goliad and
brutally shot down, by order of Santa Anna.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c4">THE MEXICAN PURSUIT</h3>
<p>Flushed with their Alamo victory, the Mexican forces were
following the colonists. Houston&rsquo;s scouts reported that General
Ramirez y Sesma and General Adrian Woll were on the west
side of the Colorado with approximately 725 troops and General
Eugenio Tolsa with 600. By this time recruits and reinforcements
had increased Houston&rsquo;s army to a strength estimated as
high as 1200.</p>
<p>The chilling news of Fannin&rsquo;s defeat, reaching the Texas forces
on March 25, impelled many to leave the ranks, to remove their
families beyond the Sabine. Those remaining clamored for action,
but Houston decided to continue his retreat. On the 26th, keeping
his own counsel, he marched his army five miles. On the 27th
the column reached the timbers of the Brazos River bottoms, and
on the 28th arrived at San Felipe de Austin, on the west bank of
the Brazos. On the 29th the army marched six miles up the river
in a driving rain, and camped on Mill Creek. On the 30th after
a fatiguing tramp of nine miles, the army reached a place across
the river from &ldquo;Bernardo,&rdquo; on one of the plantations of the
wealthy Jared E. Groce, and there camped and drilled for nearly
a fortnight.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>When the <i>ad interim</i> Texas government at Washington-on-the-Brazos
learned of the Mexicans&rsquo; approach, in mid-March, it fled
to Harrisburg. President David G. Burnet sent the commander-in-chief,
a caustic note, prodding him to stop his retreat and
fight. Secretary of War Thomas J. Rusk arrived at the camp
April 4 at Burnet&rsquo;s direction, to urge Houston to a more aggressive
course.</p>
<p>Houston having shown no disposition to fight, Santa Anna
decided to take possession of the coast and seaports, as a step
in his plan to round up the revolutionists. Crossing the Brazos
at Fort Bend (now called Richmond) on the 11th, the Mexican
general proceeded on April 14 on the road to Harrisburg, taking
with him about 700 men and one twelve-pounder cannon. Urrea
was at Matagorda with 1200 men; Gaona was somewhere between
Bastrop and San Felipe, with 725; Sesma, at Fort Bend,
with about 1,000, and Vicente Filisola between San Felipe and
Fort Bend, with nearly 1800 men.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Santa Anna arrived at Harrisburg on the 15th. There he
learned that the Burnet government had gone down Buffalo
Bayou to New Washington (now Morgan&rsquo;s Point), about
eighteen miles southeast. Burning Harrisburg, Santa Anna sped
after them. On the 19th when he arrived at New Washington
he learned that the Texas government had fled to Galveston.
Santa Anna then set out for Anahuac, via Lynchburg.</p>
<h3 id="c5">THE ROAD TO SAN JACINTO</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, on April 11th, the Texans at Groce&rsquo;s received two
small cannon, known to history as the &ldquo;Twin Sisters,&rdquo; a gift
from citizens of Cincinnati, Ohio. Thus fortified, General Houston,
after a consultation with Rusk, decided to move on to the
east side of the Brazos. The river being very high, the steamboat
&ldquo;Yellow Stone&rdquo; and a yawl were used to ferry the army
horses, cattle and baggage across. The movement began on the
12th and was completed at 1 p.m. on the 13th.</p>
<p>On the 13th Houston ordered Major Wyly Martin, Captain
Moseley Baker, and other commanders of detachments assigned
to delaying actions, to rejoin the main army at the house of
Charles Donoho, about three miles from Groce&rsquo;s. At Donoho&rsquo;s
the road from San Felipe to eastern Texas crossed the road
south from Groce&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>On April 16 the army marched twelve miles to the home of
Samuel McCurley on Spring Creek, in present Harris county. The
creek forms the boundary line between Harris and Montgomery
counties. Three miles beyond McCurley&rsquo;s was the home of Abram
Roberts at a settlement known as &ldquo;New Kentucky.&rdquo; At Roberts&rsquo;
two wagon trails crossed, one leading to Harrisburg and the other
to Robbins&rsquo; Ferry on the Trinity and on to the Sabine.</p>
<p>Many of his officers and men, as well as government officials,
believed that Houston&rsquo;s strategy was to lead the pursuing Mexicans
to the Sabine River, the eastern border of Texas. There,
it was known, were camped United States troops under General
Pendleton Gaines, with whose help the Texans might turn on
their foes and destroy them. However, on April 17, when Roberts&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
place was reached, Houston took the Harrisburg road instead
of the one toward the Louisiana line, much to the gratification
of his men. They spent the night of the 17th near the
home of Matthew Burnett on Cypress Creek, twenty miles from
McCurley&rsquo;s. On April 18 the army marched twenty miles to
White Oak Bayou in the Heights District of the present city
of Houston, and only about eight miles from Harrisburg&mdash;now
a part of Houston.</p>
<p>From two prisoners, captured by Erasmus &ldquo;Deaf&rdquo; Smith, the
famous Texas spy, Houston first learned that the Mexicans had
burned Harrisburg and had gone down the west side of the bayou
and of San Jacinto River, and that Santa Anna in person was
in command. In his march downstream Santa Anna had been
forced to cross the bridge over Vince&rsquo;s Bayou, a tributary of
Buffalo Bayou, then out of its banks. He would have to cross
the same bridge to return.</p>
<p>Viewing this strategic situation on the morning of the 19th,
Houston told his troops it looked as if they would soon get
action. And he admonished them to remember the massacres at
San Antonio and at Goliad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the Alamo!&rdquo; The soldiers took up the cry. &ldquo;Remember
Goliad!&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>In a letter to Henry Raguet he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning we are in preparation to meet Santa Anna.
It is the only chance for saving Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an address &ldquo;To the People of Texas&rdquo; he wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We view ourselves on the eve of battle. We are nerved
for the contest, and must conquer or perish.... We must act
now or abandon all hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Houston&rsquo;s force crossed Buffalo Bayou to the west side, near
the home of Isaac Batterson, two and a half miles below Harrisburg,
on the evening of the 19th. Some 248 men, mostly sick
and non-effective, were left with the baggage at the camp opposite
Harrisburg. The march was continued until midnight.</p>
<h3 id="c6">ON THE EVE OF BATTLE</h3>
<p>At dawn April 20 the Texans resumed their trek down the
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
bayou, to intercept the Mexicans. At Lynch&rsquo;s ferry, near the
juncture of Buffalo Bayou and San Jacinto River, they captured
a boat laden with supplies for Santa Anna. This probably was
some of the plunder of Harrisburg or New Washington. Ascertaining
that none of the enemy forces had crossed, the Texans
drew back about a mile on the Harrisburg road, and encamped
in a skirt of timber protected by a rising ground.</p>
<p>That afternoon, Colonel Sidney Sherman with a small detachment
of cavalry engaged the enemy infantry, almost bringing
on a general action. In the clash two Texans were wounded&mdash;one
of them, Olwyn J. Trask, mortally&mdash;and several horses were
killed. In this preliminary skirmish Mirabeau B. Lamar, a private
from Georgia (later President of the Republic of Texas),
so distinguished himself that on the next day he was placed in
command of the cavalry.</p>
<p>Santa Anna&rsquo;s blue-uniformed army made camp under the
high ground overlooking a marsh, about three-fourths of a
mile from the Texas camp. They threw up breastworks of
trunks, baggage, pack-saddles and other equipment. Both sides
prepared for the expected conflict.</p>
<p>The Texans awoke to find Thursday, April 21, a clear fine
day. Refreshed by a breakfast of bread made with flour from
the captured supplies and meat from beeves slaughtered the day
before, they were eager to attack the enemy. They could see
Santa Anna&rsquo;s flags floating over the enemy camp, and heard
the Mexican bugle calls on the crisp morning air.</p>
<p>It was discovered at about nine o&rsquo;clock that General Martin
Perfecto de Cos had crossed Vince&rsquo;s bridge, about eight miles
behind the Texans&rsquo; camp, with some 540 picked troops, swelling
the enemy forces to about 1265. General Houston ordered
&ldquo;Deaf&rdquo; Smith and a detail to destroy the bridge and prevent
further enemy reinforcements.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> This also would prevent the
retreat of either the Texans or the Mexicans toward Harrisburg.
In dry weather Vince&rsquo;s Bayou was about fifty feet wide and
ten feet deep, but the excessive April rains had made it several
times wider and deeper.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Shortly before noon, General Houston held a council of war
with Colonels Edward Burleson and Sidney Sherman, Lieutenant-Colonels
Henry Millard, Alexander Somervell and Joseph L.
Bennett, and Major Lysander Wells. Two of the officers suggested
attacking the enemy in his position, while the others favored
awaiting Santa Anna&rsquo;s attack. Houston withheld his own views,
but later, after having formed his plan of battle, submitted
it to Secretary of War Rusk, who approved it.</p>
<h3 id="c7">THE BATTLE OF SAN JACINTO</h3>
<p>General Houston disposed his forces in battle order at about
3:30 in the afternoon. Over on the Mexican side all was quiet;
many of the foemen were enjoying their customary <i>siesta</i>. The
Texans&rsquo; movements were screened by the trees and the rising
ground, and evidently Santa Anna had no lookouts posted.</p>
<p>Big, shaggy and commanding in his mud-stained unmilitary
garb, the Chieftain rode his horse up and down the line. &ldquo;Now
hold your fire, men,&rdquo; he warned in his deep voice, &ldquo;until you
get the order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the command, &ldquo;Advance,&rdquo; the patriots, 910 strong, moved
quickly out of the woods and over the rise, deploying.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> Bearded
and ragged from forty days in the field, they were a fierce-looking
band. But their long rifles were clean and well oiled.
Only one company, Captain William Wood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kentucky Rifles,&rdquo;
originally recruited by Sidney Sherman, wore uniforms.</p>
<p>The battle line was formed with Edward Burleson&rsquo;s regiment
in the center; Sherman&rsquo;s on the left wing; the artillery, under
George W. Hockley, on Burleson&rsquo;s right; the infantry, under
Henry Millard, on the right of the artillery; and the cavalry,
led by Lamar, on the extreme right.</p>
<p>Silently and tensely the Texas battle line swept across the
prairie and swale that was No Man&rsquo;s land, the men bending low.
A soldier&rsquo;s fife piped up with &ldquo;Will You Come to the Bower,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
a popular tune of the day. That was the only music of the battle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>As the troops advanced, &ldquo;Deaf&rdquo; Smith galloped up and told
Houston, &ldquo;Vince&rsquo;s bridge has been cut down.&rdquo; The General announced
it to the men. Now both armies were cut off from
retreat in all directions but one, by a roughly circular moat
formed by Vince&rsquo;s and Buffalo Bayous to the west and north,
San Jacinto River to the north and east, and by the marshes
and the bay to the east and southeast.</p>
<p>At close range, the two little cannon, drawn by rawhide
thongs, were wheeled into position and belched their charges of
iron slugs into the enemy barricade. Then the whole line, led
by Sherman&rsquo;s men, sprang forward on the run, yelling, &ldquo;Remember
the Alamo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Remember Goliad!&rdquo; All together they opened
fire, blazing away practically point-blank at the surprised and
panic-stricken Mexicans. They stormed over the breastworks,
seized the enemy&rsquo;s artillery, and joined in hand-to-hand combat,
emptying their pistols, swinging their guns as clubs, slashing
right and left with their knives. Mexicans fell by the scores
under the impact of the savage assault.</p>
<p>General Manuel Fernandez Castrillon, a brave Mexican, tried
to rally the swarthy Latins, but he was killed and his men
became crazed with fright. Many threw down their guns and
ran; many wailed, &ldquo;Me no Alamo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Me no Goliad!&rdquo; But their
pleas won no mercy. The enraged revolutionists reloaded and
chased after the stampeding enemy, shooting them, stabbing
them, clubbing them to death.</p>
<p>From the moment of the first collision the battle was a slaughter,
frightful to behold. The fugitives ran in wild terror over the
prairie and into the boggy marshes, but the avengers of the
Alamo and Goliad followed and slew them, or drove them into
the waters to drown. Men and horses, dead and dying, in the
morass in the rear and right of the Mexican camp, formed a
bridge for the pursuing Texans. Blood reddened the water. General
Houston tried to check the execution but the fury of his
men was beyond restraint.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>Some of the Mexican cavalry tried to escape over Vince&rsquo;s
bridge, only to find that the bridge was gone. In desperation,
some of the flying horsemen spurred their mounts down the
steep bank; some dismounted and plunged into the swollen
stream. The Texans came up and poured a deadly fire into the
welter of Mexicans struggling with the flood. Escape was virtually
impossible.</p>
<hr />
<p>General Houston rode slowly from the field of victory,
his ankle shattered by a rifle ball. At the foot of the oak where
he had slept the previous night he fainted and slid from his
horse into the arms of Major Hockley, his chief of staff.</p>
<p>As the crowning stroke of a glorious day, General Rusk presented
to him as a prisoner the Mexican general Almonte, who
had surrendered formally with about 400 men.</p>
<p>The casualties, according to Houston&rsquo;s official report, numbered
630 Mexicans killed, 208 wounded, and 730 taken prisoner.
As against this heavy score, only nine Texans were killed or
mortally wounded, and thirty wounded less seriously. Most of
their injuries came from the first scattered Mexican volley
when the attackers stormed their barricade. The Texans captured
a large supply of muskets, pistols, sabers, mules, horses, provisions,
clothing, tents and paraphernalia, and $12,000 in silver.</p>
<h3 id="c8">THE CAPTURE OF SANTA ANNA</h3>
<p>Santa Anna had disappeared during the battle, and next day
General Houston ordered a thorough search of the surrounding
territory for him. In the afternoon Sergeant J. A. Sylvester<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
spotted a Mexican slipping through the woods toward Vince&rsquo;s
Bayou. Sylvester and his comrades caught the fugitive trying to
hide in the high grass. He wore a common soldier&rsquo;s apparel&mdash;round
jacket, blue cotton pantaloons, skin cap and soldier&rsquo;s shoes.</p>
<p>They took the captive to camp, and on the way Mexican
prisoners recognized him and cried, &ldquo;El Presidente!&rdquo; Thus his
identity was betrayed; it was indeed the dictator from below
the Rio Grande. He was brought to General Houston, who lay
under the headquarters oak, nursing his wounded foot.</p>
<p>The Mexican President pompously announced, &ldquo;I am General
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, and a prisoner of war at your
disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Houston, suffering with pain, received him coldly.
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
He sent for young Moses Austin Bryan and Lorenzo de Zavala
Jr. to act as interpreters. Santa Anna cringed with fright as
the excited Texas soldiers pressed around him, fearing mob violence.
He pleaded for the treatment due a prisoner of war. &ldquo;You
can afford to be generous,&rdquo; he whined; &ldquo;you have captured the
Napoleon of the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What claim have you to mercy?&rdquo; Houston retorted, &ldquo;when
you showed none at the Alamo or at Goliad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked for nearly two hours, using Bryan, de Zavala
and Almonte as interpreters. In the end Santa Anna agreed to
write an order commanding all Mexican troops to evacuate
Texas. Later, treaties were signed at Velasco, looking to the adjustment
of all differences and the recognition of Texas independence.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thus ended the revolution of 1836, with an eighteen-minute
battle which established Texas as a free republic and opened the
way for the United States to extend its boundaries to the Rio
Grande on the southwest and to the Pacific on the west. Few
military engagements in history have been more decisive or of
more far-reaching ultimate influence than the battle of San
Jacinto.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Opposing Commanders&rsquo; Reports</span></h2>
<p>It is interesting to compare the accounts of the battle of
San Jacinto written by leaders of the opposing Texan and
Mexican forces.</p>
<p>General Sam Houston, in his official report of the engagement
to President David G. Burnet, dated April 25, 1836, reviewed
his movements during the three days preceding the
battle, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>About nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 21st, the enemy
were reinforced by 500 choice troops, under the command of
General Cos, increasing their effective force to upward of 1500
men, whilst our aggregate force for the field numbered 783. At
half-past three o&rsquo;clock in the evening, I ordered the officers of
the Texian army to parade their respective commands, having
in the meantime ordered the bridge on the only road communicating
with the Brazos, distant eight miles from the encampment,
to be destroyed&mdash;thus cutting off all possibility of escape.
Our troops paraded with alacrity and spirit, and were anxious
for the contest. Their conscious disparity in numbers seemed
only to increase their enthusiasm and confidence, and heightened
their anxiety for the conflict. Our situation afforded me an
opportunity of making the arrangements preparatory to the attack
without exposing our designs to the enemy. The first regiment,
commanded by Colonel Burleson, was assigned to the
center. The second regiment, under the command of Colonel
Sherman, formed the left wing of the army. The artillery, under
special command of Colonel George W. Hockley, Inspector-General,
was placed on the right of the first regiment; and four
companies of infantry, under the command of Lieut.-Col. Henry
Millard, sustained the artillery upon the right. Our cavalry, 61
in number, commanded by Colonel Mirabeau B. Lamar (whose
gallant and daring conduct on the previous day had attracted
the admiration of his comrades), completed our line. Our cavalry
was first dispatched to the front of the enemy&rsquo;s left, for the
purpose of attracting their notice, whilst an extensive island of
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
timber afforded us an opportunity of concentrating our forces,
and deploying from that point, agreeably to the previous design
of the troops. Every evolution was performed with alacrity, the
whole advancing rapidly in line, and through an open prairie,
without any protection whatever for our men. The artillery
advanced and took station within 200 yards of the enemy&rsquo;s
breastwork, and commenced an effective fire with grape and
canister.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Colonel Sherman, with his regiment, having commenced
the action upon our left wing, the whole line, at the center and
on the right, advancing in double quick time, rung the war-cry,
&lsquo;Remember the Alamo!&rsquo; received the enemy&rsquo;s fire, and advanced
within point blank shot, before a piece was discharged
from our lines. Our lines advanced without a halt, until they
were in possession of the woodland and the enemy&rsquo;s breastwork&mdash;the
right wing of Burleson&rsquo;s and the left of Millard&rsquo;s taking
possession of the breastwork; our artillery having gallantly
charged up within seventy yards of the enemy&rsquo;s cannon, when
it was taken by our troops. The conflict lasted about eighteen
minutes from the time of close action until we were in possession
of the enemy&rsquo;s encampment, taking one piece of cannon (loaded),
four stand of colors, all their camp equipage, stores and baggage.
Our cavalry had charged and routed that of the enemy
upon the right, and given pursuit to the fugitives, which did
not cease until they arrived at the bridge which I have mentioned
before&mdash;Captain Karnes, always among the foremost in
danger, commanding the pursuers. The conflict in the breastwork
lasted but a few moments; many of the troops encountered
hand to hand, and, not having the advantage of bayonets on
our side, our riflemen used their pieces as war clubs, breaking
many of them off at the breech. The rout commenced at half-past
four, and the pursuit by the main army continued until
twilight. A guard was then left in charge of the enemy&rsquo;s encampment,
and our army returned with our killed and wounded.
In the battle, our loss was two killed and twenty-three wounded,
six of them mortally. The enemy&rsquo;s loss was 630 killed ...
wounded 208 ... prisoners 730....</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h3 id="c10">MEXICAN VERSION OF BATTLE</h3>
<p>General Santa Anna, in the memoirs of his old age, wrote a
brief and untruthful account of the battle of San Jacinto, an
alibi blaming General Filisola for the defeat. He said he had
ordered Filisola to join him by forced marches, for the attack
on Houston&rsquo;s army, and was waiting for the reinforcements
when he found Houston camped on the San Jacinto. He continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>At two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of Aprl 21, 1836, I had
fallen asleep in the shade of an oak, hoping the heat would
moderate so that I might begin the march (to find Filisola),
when the filibusterers surprised my camp with admirable skill.
Imagine my surprise, on opening my eyes, and finding myself
surrounded by those people, threatening me with their rifles and
overpowering my person. The responsibility of Filisola was
obvious, because he and only he had caused such a catastrophe by
his criminal disobedience.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is somewhat at variance with an earlier report, in which
Santa Anna recounted his own heroic efforts to rally his troops
in the battle until &ldquo;the new recruits threw everything into confusion,
breaking their ranks and preventing veterans from making
use of their arms, whilst the enemy was rapidly advancing with
loud hurrahs, and in a few minutes obtained a victory which
they could not some hours before, even have dreamed of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, <i>El Presidente</i> went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>All hopes being lost, and everyone flying as fast as he could, I
found myself in the greatest danger, when a servant of my aide-de-camp
... offered me his horse, with the tenderest and
most urging expressions insisted on my riding off the field....
I remembered that General Filisola was only seventeen leagues
off, and I took my direction toward him, darting through the
enemy ranks. They pursued me, and after a ride of one league
and a half, overtook me on the banks of a large creek, the bridge
over which had been burned by the enemy to retard our pursuit.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>

<p class="pcap">ANTONIO LOPEZ de SANTA ANNA</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I alighted from my horse and with much difficulty succeeded
in concealing myself in a thicket of dwarf pines. Night
coming on I escaped them, and the hope of reaching the army
gave me strength. I crossed the creek with the water up to my
breast and continued my route on foot. I found, in a house
which had been abandoned, some articles of clothing, which
enabled me to change my apparel. At eleven o&rsquo;clock a.m., while
I was crossing a large plain, my pursuers overtook me again.
Such is the history of my capture. On account of my change
of apparel they did not recognize me, and inquired whether I
had seen Santa Anna. To this I answered that he had made his
escape; and this answer saved me from assassination, as I have
since been given to understand.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p>Colonel Pedro Delgado, of Santa Anna&rsquo;s staff, gave a more
detailed and more accurate Mexican version of the battle. He
told how Santa Anna, his staff and most of the men were
asleep when the bugler sounded the alarm of the Texan advance.
Some of the men were out gathering boughs for shelter; cavalrymen
were riding bareback, to and from water. Continuing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I stepped upon some ammunition boxes the better to observe
the movements of the enemy. I saw that their formation was a
mere line of one rank, and very extended. In their center was the
Texas flag; on both wings, they had two light cannons, well
manned. Their cavalry was opposite our front, overlapping our
left. In this disposition yelling furiously, with a brisk fire of
grape, muskets and rifles, they advanced resolutely upon our
camp. There the utmost confusion prevailed. General Castrillon
shouted on one side; on another Colonel Almonte was giving
orders; some cried out to commence firing; others to lie down
and avoid the grape shot. Among the latter was His Excellency.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Then already, I saw our men; flying in small groups, terrified,
and sheltering themselves behind large trees. I endeavored to
force some of them to fight, but all efforts were in vain&mdash;the
evil was beyond remedy; they were a bewildered and panic-stricken
herd.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The enemy kept up a brisk cross-fire of grape on the woods.
Presently we heard, in close proximity, the unpleasant noise of
their clamor. Meeting no resistance they dashed, lightning-like
upon our deserted camp.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Then I saw His Excellency running about in the utmost
excitement, wringing his hands, and unable to give an order.
General Castrillon was stretched on the ground, wounded in the
leg. Colonel Trevino was killed, and Colonel Marcial Aguirre
was severely injured. I saw also, the enemy reaching the ordnance
train, and killing a corporal and two gunners who had been detailed
to repair cartridges which had been damaged on the previous
evening.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a grove on the bayshore, Colonel Delgado said, the Texans
wrought the worst carnage of the battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>There they killed Colonel Batres; and it would have been
all over with us had not Providence placed us in the hands of
the noble and generous captain of cavalry, Allen, who by great
exertion, saved us repeatedly from being slaughtered by the
drunken and infuriated volunteers.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">San Jacinto Monument</span></h2>
<p>The great shaft of San Jacinto, piercing the sky from the
scene of the historic conflict between Sam Houston&rsquo;s pioneers
and Santa Anna&rsquo;s Mexican invaders, was erected as
a memorial to the Texas heroes, commemorating the Centennial of
1836. Appropriations aggregating $1,866,148 were made by the
State of Texas and the Federal Government for the construction
of the monument and improvement of San Jacinto State Park. Of
this amount approximately $1,200,000 was used in building the
monument.</p>
<p>On April 21, 1936, the one hundredth anniversary of the battle
of San Jacinto, with impressive ceremonies, the ground was
broken for the monument. Among the participants was General
Andrew Jackson Houston, only surviving child of the Commander-in-Chief
of the Texas Army at San Jacinto. The monument,
570 feet high, was officially dedicated April 21, 1939.</p>
<p>The reinforced concrete structure is faced with rough sawn
fossilized limestone quarried near Leander, Williamson County,
Texas. The interior walls are highly polished. The base of the
building is 124 feet square and 36 feet high. The shaft is 47 feet
square at the base and 30 feet at the top.</p>
<p>On the exterior walls of the shaft, about 90 feet above the
ground, a frieze 178 feet around and 15&frac12; feet high shows in
relief the history of Texas from the coming of the Anglo-Americans
to the present day. This was executed by William McVey,
Houston sculptor.</p>
<p>On the outer sides of the base of the monument are carved
inscriptions, summarizing the salient events of the Texas revolution.
Each of these eight spaces measures 25 feet by 13 feet, and
the letters in the inscriptions are 8 inches in height. Written by
L. W. Kemp with collaboration of Dr. E. C. Barker, Mrs. Herbert
Gambrell and other historical authorities, they epitomize the
whole evolution of Texas independence in approximately 600
words.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>There are five rooms on the first floor of the monument. The
entrance is through the Hall of Honor, which is flanked by two
spacious rooms. The south room houses the exhibits relating to
the Spanish and Mexican period of Texas history, many of them
donated by Colonel and Mrs. George A. Hill, Jr. Exhibits in the
north room relate to the Anglo-American period until the beginning
of the War between the States. An entrance lobby from
the Hall of Honor leads to the elevator which runs to the observation
deck in the tower. The elevator lobby serves as a gallery
for paintings. Behind the elevator is a small room connecting
the north and south rooms. It is devoted to relics of domestic
life.</p>
<p>Two great bronze plaques adorn the interior walls of the monument.
One, in the south room, records the names of the 910
heroes who fought in the battle; the other, in the north room,
lists the 248 men of Houston&rsquo;s army, mostly sick and non-effectives,
who were detailed to remain at the camp established opposite
Harrisburg. The lists were compiled by L. W. Kemp. In this
booklet they were revised to January 1, 1947.</p>
<p>The monument was designed by Alfred C. Finn and was constructed
by the W. S. Bellows Construction Company of
Houston.</p>
<p>Operation and maintenance of the monument and museum is
financed, without cost to the State, by receipts from a small fee
charged for riding the elevator to the observation tower, and by
the sale of souvenirs. The San Jacinto Museum of History Association,
which operates the monument, is a non-profit organization
incorporated under the laws of Texas, November 7, 1938.
Members of the Association&rsquo;s board of trustees are nominated
by the San Jacinto State Park Board and approved by the State
Board of Control.</p>
<h3 id="c12">THE FIELD OF ST. HYACINTH</h3>
<p>It is told that Franciscan friars of Mexico, exploring the Texas
coast during the period 1751-1772, found the stream now
known as San Jacinto River so choked with water hyacinths
(a mauve species of lily that still abounds in this region) that
they could not pass. They called it the &ldquo;hyacinth stream.&rdquo; From
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
that name evolved &ldquo;San Jacinto&rdquo;&mdash;Spanish for &ldquo;Saint Hyacinth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Legend has it that Adjutant General John A. Wharton gave
the battlefield its name. Santa Anna, shortly after being captured,
while conversing with a group of Texan officers inquired
concerning the correct name of the field. One officer is supposed
to have answered &ldquo;Lynchburg,&rdquo; but Wharton suggested
&ldquo;San Jacinto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battleground, off the La Porte road, some twenty-three
miles from the County Courthouse in Houston, is a State park
of 402 acres. It is situated near the confluence of San
Jacinto River and Buffalo Bayou&mdash;now the Houston Ship Channel&mdash;not
far from the Bay. It is a spot of natural beauty. The
land has a gentle roll, and vegetation is brilliant. Wild flowers
here grow in profusion and fairly radiate their splendor. Nowhere
else in this section are more luxuriant mossy &ldquo;beards&rdquo;
to be found than on the huge liveoaks of San Jacinto.</p>
<p>The country surrounding the battlefield and nearby Lynchburg&mdash;known
in the old days as &ldquo;Lynch&rsquo;s Ferry&rdquo;&mdash;was one of
the early settlements of Texas colonists. The sylvan retreats along
the wide stream and adjacent lagoons were once popular as
homes of prominent Texans. Across the bayou from the battleground
was the home of Lorenzo de Zavala, <i>ad interim</i> Vice
President of the Republic.</p>
<p>Nearby lived David G. Burnet, <i>ad interim</i> President. Later
General Houston had a home on Trinity Bay, a few miles from
the battlefield. It is now a Boy Scout camp. Ashbel Smith, minister
of the Republic of Texas to England, had his home at about
the site of present Goose Creek, not far from Lynchburg.</p>

<p>The thumbnail history of the Texas revolution, inscribed
on the exterior of the monument&rsquo;s base in eight panels,
is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE EARLY POLICIES OF MEXICO TOWARD
HER TEXAS COLONISTS HAD BEEN EXTREMELY
LIBERAL. LARGE GRANTS OF LAND
WERE MADE TO THEM, AND NO TAXES OR
DUTIES IMPOSED. THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE ANGLO-AMERICANS AND
MEXICANS WAS CORDIAL. BUT, FOLLOWING
A SERIES OF REVOLUTIONS BEGUN IN
1829, UNSCRUPULOUS RULERS SUCCESSIVELY
SEIZED POWER IN MEXICO. THEIR
UNJUST ACTS AND DESPOTIC DECREES
LED TO THE REVOLUTION IN TEXAS.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>IN JUNE, 1832, THE COLONISTS FORCED
THE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES AT ANAHUAC
TO RELEASE WM. B. TRAVIS AND OTHERS
FROM UNJUST IMPRISONMENT. THE BATTLE
OF VELASCO, JUNE 26, AND THE BATTLE
OF NACOGDOCHES, AUGUST 2, FOLLOWED:
IN BOTH THE TEXANS WERE VICTORIOUS.
STEPHEN FULLER AUSTIN, &ldquo;FATHER OF
TEXAS&rdquo;, WAS ARRESTED JANUARY 3, 1834,
AND HELD IN MEXICO WITHOUT TRIAL
UNTIL JULY, 1835. THE TEXANS FORMED
AN ARMY, AND ON NOVEMBER 12, 1835,
ESTABLISHED A PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.</p>
<p>THE FIRST SHOT OF THE REVOLUTION
OF 1835-1836 WAS FIRED BY THE TEXANS
AT GONZALES, OCTOBER 2, 1835, IN RESISTANCE
TO A DEMAND BY MEXICAN
SOLDIERS FOR A SMALL CANNON HELD BY
THE COLONISTS. THE MEXICAN GARRISON
AT GOLIAD FELL OCTOBER 9, THE BATTLE
OF CONCEPCION WAS WON BY THE TEXANS,
OCTOBER 28. SAN ANTONIO WAS CAPTURED
DECEMBER 10, 1835 AFTER FIVE DAYS OF
FIGHTING IN WHICH THE INDOMITABLE
BENJAMIN R. MILAM DIED A HERO, AND
THE MEXICAN ARMY EVACUATED TEXAS.</p>
<p>TEXAS DECLARED HER INDEPENDENCE AT
WASHINGTON-ON-THE-BRAZOS, MARCH 2.
FOR NEARLY TWO MONTHS HER ARMIES
MET DISASTER AND DEFEAT; DR. JAMES
GRANT&rsquo;S MEN WERE KILLED ON THE AGUA
DULCE, MARCH 2, WILLIAM BARRET TRAVIS
AND HIS MEN SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES
AT THE ALAMO, MARCH 6, WILLIAM WARD
WAS DEFEATED AT REFUGIO, MARCH 14,
AMON B. KING&rsquo;S MEN WERE EXECUTED
NEAR REFUGIO, MARCH 16, AND JAMES
WALKER FANNIN AND HIS ARMY WERE PUT
TO DEATH NEAR GOLIAD, MARCH 27, 1836.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>ON THIS FIELD ON APRIL 21, 1836 THE
ARMY OF TEXAS COMMANDED BY GENERAL
SAM HOUSTON, AND ACCOMPANIED BY THE
SECRETARY OF WAR, THOMAS J. RUSK, ATTACKED
THE SUPERIOR INVADING ARMY OF
MEXICANS UNDER GENERAL SANTA ANNA.
THE BATTLE LINE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
WAS FORMED BY SIDNEY SHERMAN&rsquo;S REGIMENT,
EDWARD BURLESON&rsquo;S REGIMENT,
THE ARTILLERY COMMANDED BY GEORGE W.
HOCKLEY, HENRY MILLARD&rsquo;S INFANTRY AND
THE CAVALRY UNDER MIRABEAU B. LAMAR.
SAM HOUSTON LED THE INFANTRY CHARGE.</p>
<p>WITH THE BATTLE CRY, &ldquo;REMEMBER THE
ALAMO! REMEMBER GOLIAD!&rdquo; THE TEXANS
CHARGED. THE ENEMY, TAKEN BY SURPRISE,
RALLIED FOR A FEW MINUTES,
THEN FLED IN DISORDER. THE TEXANS
HAD ASKED NO QUARTER AND GAVE NONE.
THE SLAUGHTER WAS APPALLING, VICTORY
COMPLETE, AND TEXAS FREE! ON THE FOLLOWING
DAY GENERAL ANTONIO LOPEZ DE
SANTA ANNA, SELF-STYLED &ldquo;NAPOLEON OF
THE WEST,&rdquo; RECEIVED FROM A GENEROUS

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">Brigham Monument</span></h2>
<h3 id="c15">DEAD ON THE FIELD OF HONOR</h3>
<p>Prior to the erection of the present great shaft, the principal
memorial on the battlefield was a plain square spire
monument of Rutland variegated marble, fifteen and one-half
feet high, which with the base stands seventeen feet. After
its dedication it was placed at the grave of Benjamin R. Brigham,
one of the nine Texans who were killed or mortally wounded in
the battle, and whose bodies, with one exception, were buried on
the ground on which the Texan army had camped April 20.
Board markers had been placed at all of the graves but when in
1879 Judge J. L. Sullivan of Richmond, Texas, began to raise
funds by public subscription to erect a joint monument where
their bodies lay, the grave of Brigham was alone recognizable.</p>
<p>The monument was unveiled at Galveston with fitting ceremonies
August 25, 1881, Temple Houston, youngest son of General
Sam Houston, being the orator of the occasion. On April
23, 1883, the Eighteenth Legislature purchased for $1,500, ten
acres of land surrounding the monument. This was the beginning
of the present San Jacinto State Park.</p>
<p>Carved on the east front of the monument is:
<span class="center">&ldquo;DEAD ON THE FIELD OF HONOR&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Below which, in bold relief is a Lone Star, surrounded by a
wreath of oak and laurel leaves.</p>
<p>Beneath the star:
<span class="center">&ldquo;B. R. BRIGHAM&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>On the base:
<span class="center">&ldquo;SAN JACINTO&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Near the top of the shaft is a polished band, upon which are
cut two stars on each front and one above the band on the east
front. These represent the nine who fell in the battle.</p>

<p>On the north front, beneath the heading:</p>
<p class="center">&ldquo;TWO DAYS BEFORE THE BATTLE&rdquo;</p>
<p>is recorded the statement of General Houston:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>This morning we are in preparation to meet Santa Anna.
It is the only chance of saving Texas. From time to time I have
looked for reinforcements in vain: We will only have about
seven hundred men to march with besides the camp guard. We
go on to conquer. It is wisdom growing out of necessity to meet
the enemy now. Every consideration enforces it. No previous occasion
would justify it. The troops are in fine spirits and now is
the time for action. We shall use our best efforts to fight the
enemy to such advantage as will insure victory though the odds
are greatly against us.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I leave the result in the hands of a wise God, and rely upon
His providence.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My country will do justice to those who serve her. The right
for which we fight will be secured, and Texas free.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below this is inscribed:
<span class="center">&ldquo;REMEMBER THE ALAMO&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>On the south front beneath the heading:
<span class="center">&ldquo;THE DAY AFTER THE BATTLE&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>is the report of Thomas J. Rusk, Secretary of War:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The sun was sinking in the horizon as the battle commenced,
but, at the close of the conflict, the sun of liberty and independence
rose in Texas, never, it is to be hoped, to be obscured by
the clouds of despotism. We have read of deeds of chivalry, and
pursued with ardour the annals of war; we have contemplated,
with the highest emotions of sublimity, the loud roaring thunder,
the desolating tornado, and the withering simoon of the
desert; but neither of these, nor all, inspired us with emotions
like those felt on this occasion! There was a general cry which
pervaded the ranks: Remember the ALAMO! Remember LA
BAHIA! These words electrified all. Onward was the cry. The
unerring aim and irresistible energy of the Texan army could
not be withstood, it was freemen fighting against the minions
of tyranny and the result proved the inequality of such a
contest.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
